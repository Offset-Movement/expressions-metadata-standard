# A metadata standard for attributes @ Expressions of Peace and Demands  

This will be an observable process; where NFTs build peer-to-peer consensus interactions and history on blockchain. 

Currently extending ![ Opensea's metadata standard](https://docs.opensea.io/docs/metadata-standards#metadata-structure).

In the near future, an off-chain solution will be developed with ![holochain](https://holochain.org), for collaborative and private editing/expressing together. For persistence layer, IPFS and maybe filecoin will be there, and a few more solution on the table.

Including ![Lens protocol](https://lens.dev/) to create a twitter-like interaction adoption, facilitating engagement between peers. It's on Polygon network.

We might just start multiple projects around implementation/prototyping of the flows and see which side better evolves. 

It might be the case that, we have multiple projects co-existing in multiple networks and ecosystems. 

Expressions' NFTs will not be transferrable, they are part of our decentralised ids/DIDs.
Incorporating with ![KILT protocol](https://kilt.io) on ![attestation](https://dev.kilt.io/docs/sdk/workshop/attestation) state. 
Supplementing the flow, we'll soon create ![cTypes](https://dev.kilt.io/docs/sdk/workshop/attester/ctype) for Expressions of Peace and Demand.
As well as incentives that reward with $kilt on Polkadot network.

>> Expressions

```
Expressions of Peace and Demand; are designed as facilitating a future-driven peer-to-peer diplomacy, via consensus contracts with peace making capacity by design.

They have types and scales, as attributes included; a single document as well can contain expressions 

peer-to-peer:

people-to-people
org-2-people-2-org 
org-to-org,
